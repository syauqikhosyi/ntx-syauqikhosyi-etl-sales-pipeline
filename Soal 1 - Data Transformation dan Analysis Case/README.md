# Data Transformation Case
As part of data team in NTX Solution, we deal with different kinds of data on a daily basis. We are responsible for various data acquisition and processing method in order to provide the best solution for our clients.

## Case study
The client wants to better understand user behavior and improve its ecommerce platform. The management has identified several scenarios where more data could be helpful:
* Identify top products based on the total transaction revenue per day.
* Detect any anomalies, such as a sharp decrease or increase in the number of transactions for a specific product.
* Identify the most profitable city or province based on the total transaction revenue.

## Dataset
The dataset it's a part of the 'data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions' dataset from Google Big Query. This dataset includes visitor ID, visit time, product SKU, product name, transaction count, city, province, and more.

## Tasks
Your tasks are twofold. First, solve the case study using ChatGPT as an assistant. For this, you need to document the prompt you are giving to ChatGPT, the results produced by ChatGPT, and your analysis of these results. Second, improve upon the solution provided by ChatGPT. This involves analyzing the solution generated by ChatGPT, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing these enhancements. These could be in terms of data processing, accuracy of the analysis, visualization, handling edge cases, or anything else that you think would lead to a better solution. Justify why these improvements are necessary and how they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

## Deliverable
Present your work in a Jupyter notebook or equivalent. For each step in the process, provide comments and explanations detailing your thought process and decision-making rationale. Show not only your final results but also your approach to each task and any challenges you encountered along the way.

Remember, we value process just as much as the final results. Therefore, it is crucial to include the specific prompts you've given to ChatGPT, the outputs it has generated, and the improvements you've made based on those outputs. Use your findings to provide insights on user behavior and recommendations for improving the ecommerce platform.
